ShaderHub is an experimental **WebGPU-based shader playground**.  
It is designed as a **demo tool** for exploring graphics programming, with a focus on **education and learning WebGPU**, rather than replacing other platforms.

You can test it here: [upf-gti.github.io/ShaderHub/](https://upf-gti.github.io/ShaderHub/)

> ⚠️ You will probably find bugs on the way, please report them to this repository issues section!
