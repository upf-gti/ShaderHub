ShaderHub allows you to remix shaders created by other users (remix has to be enabled).
Remixing means creating your own version of an existing shader while keeping attribution to the original author.

    docMaker.paragraph(`
To remix a shader, open the shader editor for a remix-enabled shader and click the "Remix" button.
This will create a new shader in your account that contains the original code as a starting point.
You can then modify, add new passes, change uniforms, or experiment freely without affecting the original shader.
`);

    docMaker.paragraph(`
Once you have modified a remixed shader, you can save it to your account, share it using a direct link or iFrame, and even export it as a WGSL file just like any other shader.
`);

    docMaker.paragraph(`
All remixed shaders automatically keep a reference to the original author.
The original author receives credit for the base shader, ensuring proper recognition while still allowing creative freedom.
