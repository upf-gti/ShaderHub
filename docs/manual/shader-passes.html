ShaderHub shaders are built from one or more shader passes.
Each pass represents a stage of GPU execution and can either render to a texture,
perform a computation, or provide shared code used by other passes.

By combining multiple passes, you can create complex effects such as multi-step rendering,
feedback loops, simulations, post-processing chains, or procedural data generation.

    docMaker.paragraph(`
Each pass runs independently on the GPU and produces an output.
That output can be consumed by other passes through channels, allowing data to flow
from one stage to the next.
`);

    docMaker.paragraph(`
Passes are executed in a defined order.
This makes it possible to build effects incrementally, where earlier passes compute
or store intermediate results that later passes reuse.

ShaderHub supports three types of passes.
Each type serves a different purpose in the rendering pipeline.

For simple shaders, a single image pass may be enough.
As your shader grows in complexity, multiple passes help keep things structured and efficient.
