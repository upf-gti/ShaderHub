Channels are input slots that allow shaders to read external data.
They are commonly used to connect textures and sounds from the ShaderHub asset library, or the outputs of other passes
to image or compute shaders.

Each shader pass has access to up to four channels, named
<span class="font-bold font-code">iChannel0</span> through <span class="font-bold font-code">iChannel3</span>.
This makes channels the primary mechanism for passing data
between different stages of a shader.

Channel inputs are assigned through the editor interface.

To assign a resource to a channel:

Channels are automatically bound and made available to your shader as input resources.
The way you access each channel depends on the type of asset connected to it.
ShaderHub currently supports the following channel types:

Each pass supports a maximum of four channels.
If more inputs are required, intermediate passes can be used
to combine or preprocess data before passing it forward.
`);

    docMaker.paragraph(`
Channels are read-only from the perspective of the shader.
Writing data is performed by rendering to textures in image passes
or explicitly storing values in compute passes.

    docMaker.paragraph(`
Use channels whenever your shader needs external or intermediate data.
They are the main way to structure complex shaders and enable reuse between passes.
